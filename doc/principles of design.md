## Why I create this project/repository?
I love making **drawings/plots/graphs/graphics/images/illustrations/visualizations/typesettings** and everything like these. Unfortunately, I am not good at drawing by hand, so those computer programs become my best friends.

I know that there have been a large number of tools for such kinds of work, and I have used or have been using most of them, the popular, the unpopular and even the dead.

However, many users (like me) might ignore some important points while learning and using these tools.

The first ignored thing is the differences/gaps among the tasks I have emphasized above. The relationships among them are not really clear in most daily communications. 

There is no single tool suitable for all tasks. **"No silver bullet."** I always remember this aphorism.

The question is something like "Why are there so many programming languages", or more appropriate to this case, "Why do people keep inventing/creating new programming languages".

One of the core ideas in such questions is: **Different tools for different tasks.** People have to keep balance between **generality** and **specificity**. More generality, less specificity; more specificity, less generality. This is similar to the relationships between domain-specific language (DSL) and general-purpose language (GPL).

The second ignored thing is the differences among users at different levels with different preferences. There are two main classification standards: beginners and experts; GUIers and CLIers.

Beginners want to get the jobs done quickly and simply, while experts take more focus on the speed, extendability, flexibility and so on of the tool.

GUIers like the real-time feedbacks of changes to graphics, while CLIers love the accuracy and reusability of scripts and programs.

The third ignored thing is the differences among the structures of different tools. There are two main
